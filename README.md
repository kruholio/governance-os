# governance-os

## 1. Abstract

This repository contains the architecture for **governance-os** (Democracy 5.0), a governance operating system that replaces political arbitrariness with mathematical and scientific integrity. It is designed to provide stable hardware (social structure) on which progressive programs (“apps”) can run efficiently and securely.

The axioms (kernel constants)
Every pull request (policy proposal) must be validated against these constants:

1. **Mathematics is always right**
2. **Physics wins** 
3. **Love is love**

## 2. The System Stack (Layer Model)

### L1: The Kernel (Axioms & Logic)

The lowest level defines the immutable ground rules against which every operation is checked:

- **Mathematics is always right:** Decisions must be logically consistent.

- **Physics wins:** Political goals are negotiable, but the means must follow the laws of nature and scientific evidence.

- **Love is love:** A hard constraint for the absolute equality and equal opportunities of all people.


### L2: Hardware Abstraction (VC)

The **Voting Core (VC)** acts as a statistical “digital twin” of society.

- **Algorithm:** Uses the Hamilton method to map the population with demographic accuracy.

- **Self-healing:** Automatic correction processes for deviations in representation of more than ±3%.


### L3: The runtime environment (governance processes)

Politics is carried out here as a **scientific experiment protocol**:

- **Git principle:** Every measure is a pull request (PR). Every change is versioned (commits, rollbacks).

- **Linter/compiler (ISAC):** The Independent Scientific Audit Council checks PRs for physical feasibility and logical errors before they are merged.


### L4: Application Layer (Policies)

This is where the actual programs run (e.g., education reforms, climate protection policies). This layer is highly agile and is constantly validated by real-world data.

## 3. Installation & Participation

The system is designed as an open-source framework. We invite developers, scientists, and citizens to collaborate on the following modules:

- **System architects:** Refining the statistical selection algorithms.
    
- **Security auditors (ISAC):** Establishment of scientific review bodies.

- **UI/UX designers:** Translation of complex data into understandable citizen dashboards.

---

## 4. Goal (Exit Strategy)

The system will be successful when it becomes **obsolete**: once global equality and scientific rationality have become the standard for human civilization, the OS will have fulfilled its purpose.

**“Against entropy! For humanity!”**
